Great question 👍 Let’s go step by step so you fully understand **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**, and also the screen you shared for **Recovery Services Vault creation**.

---

# 🔹 What is Azure Site Recovery (ASR)?

Azure Site Recovery is Microsoft’s **Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)**.
It helps you keep applications and workloads running during:

* Planned outages (like maintenance or migration),
* Unplanned outages (like hardware failure, datacenter down, or natural disaster).

👉 In simple words:

* **ASR continuously replicates your on-premises or Azure VMs** (primary site) to another Azure region (secondary site).
* If the primary site goes down, you **fail over** to the secondary site.
* When the primary comes back, you can **fail back**.

---

# 🔹 Where Recovery Services Vault fits in

A **Recovery Services Vault** is the **management container** where Azure stores:

* Replication policies
* Configuration for ASR
* Recovery points of VMs
* Backup data (it’s also used for Azure Backup)

📌 So before you can enable Site Recovery, you must first **create a Recovery Services Vault**.

# 🔹 The Image You Shared (Create Recovery Services Vault)

You’re at the **Basics tab** of vault creation.

### Fields explained:

### 1. **Subscription**

* The Azure subscription that will be billed and where the vault will live.
* Example: `Azure subscription 1`.

### 2. **Resource group**

* A logical container for grouping related resources.
* You chose: `myapp-rg`.
* This means all resources related to your app (including the vault) will be grouped together.

### 3. **Vault Name**

* A globally unique name you’ll assign to the vault.
* Example: `myapp-recovery-vault`.

### 4. **Region**

* The Azure region where the vault will be created.
* Important: **The vault must be in the same region as the resources you want to protect**.
* Example: You selected **East US**, so this vault can protect workloads running in East US.

💡 Note: In DR design, you usually create **two vaults**, one in each region:

* Vault 1 → East US (protects East US workloads, replicates to West US).
* Vault 2 → West US (protects West US workloads, replicates to East US).

# 🔹 Tabs You See at the Top

* **Basics** → Define subscription, RG, vault name, and region.
* **Redundancy** → Choose storage replication for your backups (Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) or Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)).
* **Encryption** → Decide how data inside the vault is encrypted (Microsoft-managed keys or customer-managed keys).
* **Vault properties** → Configure things like cross-subscription restore.
* **Networking** → Set up private endpoints if you want vault traffic to go over private network instead of public Internet.
* **Tags** → Add metadata tags (for cost tracking, e.g., `Environment=Prod`).
* **Review + create** → Final validation before creation.

# 🔹 Example Scenario

### Use Case: Protecting SQL Always On in Azure (East US ↔ West US)

1. You have **SQL Server 2019 Always On Availability Group** in Azure VMs running in **East US**.
2. You want a DR plan to **West US** in case East US region goes down.
3. Steps:

   * Create a **Recovery Services Vault** in **East US** → used to configure replication of East US VMs to West US.
   * Configure **Azure Site Recovery** in the vault → enable replication for SQL VMs.
   * ASR will continuously replicate disks + data to West US.
   * During a disaster, you trigger **Failover** from vault → SQL VMs start in West US.
   * After East US is healthy again, you can **Failback**.

👉 In this design:

* Vault = Control plane + Storage for recovery metadata.
* Site Recovery = Engine doing replication and failover.

---

# 🔹 Key Benefits of ASR

* **Business continuity** → Apps keep running during failures.
* **Cost effective** → No need to maintain a physical DR datacenter.
* **Orchestration** → Automated failover/failback, recovery plans (sequence of actions).
* **Flexibility** → Works for Azure-to-Azure, on-prem-to-Azure, or VMware-to-Azure.

---

✅ In summary:

* **Azure Site Recovery** = Replicates workloads for disaster recovery.
* **Recovery Services Vault** = Container to manage ASR policies, replication, and recovery data.
* In your screenshot, you’re setting up this vault as the **first step** before enabling ASR for your SQL VMs or other workloads.
