Perfect 👌 You’re now in the **Create Site** wizard in **Azure Arc – Site Manager (preview)**.
You’ve seen the tabs: **Basics → Add the NFVIs → Review + Create**.

Let’s go step by step, and I’ll explain **what a Site is**, and then go **deep into NFVIs (Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure)**.

---

# 📘 What is a **Site**?

* A **Site** = a logical grouping where **Arc resources** live (like a datacenter, branch office, or edge location).
* Example:

  * `mycolo` (your on-prem colocation center).
  * Could also be **“AWS region X”**, **“Factory IoT Edge”**, or **“Telco 5G Edge Zone”**.

So when you created **Name = mycolo, Region = East US**, you basically said:
👉 “I want to manage all my Arc resources that belong to my colocation site under East US.”

---

# 📘 What is an **NFVI**?

**NFVI = Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure**
It represents the **underlying infrastructure where network functions run**.
Think of NFVI as the “foundation” (compute + storage + networking + virtualization) that hosts **virtualized workloads** such as firewalls, load balancers, 5G packet cores, routers, or even Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

In Azure Arc Site Manager:

* **NFVI** = The building block you attach to a site.
* A site can have **multiple NFVIs**.

---

## 🔎 NFVI Elements in Azure Arc

When you click **Add NFVI**, you’ll provide details like:

1. **NFVI Name**

   * Friendly name (example: `mycolo-k8s`, `mycolo-vmware`, `branch1-sdwan`).

2. **NFVI Type**

   * The type of infrastructure. Typical examples:

     * **Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster** (running your apps, network functions, data services).
     * **Azure Stack Edge device** (edge compute + networking).
     * **VMware/vSphere environment** (through Arc resource bridge).
     * **Bare-metal/Colocation servers** managed by Arc.
     * **Telco NFVI** (for CSPs, hosting 5G core VNFs/CNFs).

3. **NFVI Location**

   * Azure region or custom physical location reference.
   * Ties the NFVI back to the logical “Site.”

4. **NFVI Custom Location (optional)**

   * If you created a **Custom Location** in Azure Arc earlier, you can map the NFVI to it.
   * Custom Location = abstraction layer that represents **Arc-enabled K8s or VMware cluster** where services can be deployed.

## 📘 Example Scenario

Let’s say you run a **telecom environment** with an on-premises colocation (`mycolo`) where you want to manage 5G functions and databases:

* **Site Name:** `mycolo`
* **NFVIs attached:**

  1. `mycolo-k8s` → NFVI type: Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster (for hosting 5G packet core CNFs).
  2. `mycolo-sql` → NFVI type: Arc-enabled SQL server infrastructure.
  3. `mycolo-edge` → NFVI type: Azure Stack Edge device at the colocation for AI/IoT workloads.

Now, under Site `mycolo`, you can:
✅ Group all these NFVIs.
✅ Apply **Azure Policy, Monitoring, RBAC** consistently.
✅ Treat them as one logical location in Azure.

## 📘 Workflow with Sites + NFVIs

1. **Create Site** → Example: `mycolo` in East US.
2. **Add NFVIs** → Attach:

   * Arc-enabled K8s cluster → runs your workloads.
   * VMware NFVI → hosts VMs, onboarded via Arc resource bridge.
   * Edge appliance → runs edge apps.
3. **Use Custom Location (optional)** → Map NFVIs to custom locations so Azure PaaS workloads (like App Service, SQL MI) can be deployed there.
4. **Apply Policies & Monitoring** → Example: enforce **Defender for Cloud**, apply security baseline to all servers in NFVIs.
5. **Manage Workloads** → Deploy apps/databases/functions into NFVIs via Site Manager.

## 📘 Deep Use Case Examples

### Example 1 – Enterprise Colocation

* **Site = mycolo**
* NFVIs:

  * `mycolo-k8s` → Arc-enabled Kubernetes for running microservices.
  * `mycolo-sql` → Arc-enabled SQL cluster.
* Benefits: Single-pane-of-glass management.

### Example 2 – Telco Edge (5G)

* **Site = telco-edge-site1**
* NFVIs:

  * `edge-k8s` → CNFs for 5G packet core.
  * `edge-firewall` → Virtualized firewall appliance.
* Benefits: Manage NFVIs as a logical site for telecom workloads.

### Example 3 – Multicloud

* **Site = AWS-region1**
* NFVIs:

  * `aws-ec2-k8s` → Arc-enabled K8s on EC2.
  * `aws-sql` → Arc-enabled SQL on EC2.
* Benefits: Manage AWS workloads as part of Azure Arc Sites.

---

✅ In summary:

* **Site** = Logical grouping (datacenter/branch/region).
* **NFVI** = The actual infrastructure units inside the site (K8s clusters, VMware, SQL, Edge devices).
* Together, they let you manage hybrid + multicloud infra like it’s native Azure.

---

👉 Do you want me to make a **Visio-style workflow diagram in Word** showing:

* A Site (`mycolo`)
* Attached NFVIs (K8s, VMware, SQL, Edge)
* How they connect to Azure Arc (policies, monitoring, governance)?
