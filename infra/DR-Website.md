Perfect üëç You‚Äôre now asking about **full application Disaster Recovery (DR)** ‚Äî not just SQL Always On, but **Java app + DB + pods + networking** across **US East ‚Üí US West**.
Let‚Äôs go **deeper** into how Azure Site Recovery (ASR), Load Balancers, and other services come together.

---

# üîπ DR Design Goal

You want your **entire website** (front-end, app tier, DB tier, and supporting pods) to survive an outage in **East US** by failing over to **West US** with minimal downtime.

---

# üîπ Typical Application Stack

1. **Frontend**

   * Web app hosted on Java App Service (PaaS) or Java VM (IaaS).
   * Load Balancer / Application Gateway / Azure Front Door in front.

2. **Backend**

   * Java application running in:

     * Azure VM, OR
     * Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) pods.

3. **Database**

   * SQL Server Always On Availability Groups (IaaS).
   * OR Azure SQL Database with Geo-Replication.
   * OR MySQL/PostgreSQL Flexible Server with geo-redundancy.

4. **Other dependencies**

   * Redis, Storage Accounts, Key Vault, etc.

---

# üîπ Disaster Recovery Options Per Tier

### 1. **Java App (VM-based)**

* Use **Azure Site Recovery** to replicate VMs from East US ‚Üí West US.
* Continuous replication of disks (OS + data).
* In failover, VM boots up in West US with same configuration.

### 2. **Java App (App Service / PaaS)**

* Use **App Service Deployment Slots** with **Active-Active** across regions.
* Or use **Traffic Manager / Front Door** to switch traffic between East US and West US.
* Example:

  * East US App Service = Primary
  * West US App Service = Secondary (kept warm/synced with CI/CD pipeline).
  * Failover is DNS-based or Front Door-based.

### 3. **Kubernetes Pods (AKS)**

* AKS clusters are **region-specific**.
* For DR:

  * Run **two AKS clusters** (East US + West US).
  * Sync app manifests using GitOps (ArgoCD/FluxCD) or CI/CD pipelines.
  * Store container images in **Azure Container Registry (Geo-replicated)**.
  * Use **Azure Traffic Manager / Front Door** for cross-region routing.

### 4. **Database**

* **SQL Server Always On** with listener across regions (needs ILB + load balancer).
* **Azure SQL Database** ‚Üí Geo-replication or Auto-failover group.
* **MySQL/PostgreSQL Flexible Server** ‚Üí Geo-redundant enabled.
* Always ensure **transactional consistency** in DR design.

### 5. **Storage Accounts / Blobs**

* Use **GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage)**.
* During failover ‚Üí storage automatically available in West US.

### 6. **Secrets / Keys**

* Azure Key Vault with **Geo-Replication enabled**.
* Ensures same secrets available across regions.

---

# üîπ Network + Load Balancing

To provide **seamless failover**, you need:

* **Azure Front Door (recommended)**

  * Global load balancer + WAF + SSL termination.
  * Routes user traffic to closest healthy region (East US or West US).
  * Supports automatic failover based on health probes.

* **Traffic Manager (DNS-based)**

  * Routes requests to primary region (East US) or fails over to secondary (West US).
  * Slower than Front Door (DNS TTL-based).

* **Internal Load Balancers (ILB)**

  * Inside VNet, used for SQL Always On listener.
  * Needed for cross-region SQL failover.

---

# üîπ Step-by-Step End-to-End Flow (East US ‚Üí West US)

### Step 1: **Networking & Vaults**

* Create **VNet in East US** + **VNet in West US**.
* Peer VNets for replication (or use VNet-to-VNet VPN).
* Create **Recovery Services Vault** in both regions.

### Step 2: **Database DR**

* If SQL Always On:

  * Deploy Availability Group across East US and West US VMs.
  * Configure **Azure Load Balancer (ILB)** for SQL Listener in each region.
  * Create **Global Listener** entry in DNS.
* If Azure SQL Database:

  * Enable **Auto-failover group** from East US ‚Üí West US.

### Step 3: **App DR (VMs or App Service)**

* **VMs:** Enable replication to West US using ASR.
* **App Service:** Deploy active in both regions. Keep sync via CI/CD pipeline.
* **AKS:** Deploy cluster in both regions, sync manifests, enable Azure Container Registry geo-replication.

### Step 4: **Storage & State**

* Use **GRS storage accounts** for blob/file storage.
* Use **geo-replicated Key Vault** for secrets.
* Use **CosmosDB with multi-region writes** if applicable.

### Step 5: **Load Balancing**

* Deploy **Azure Front Door** with backend pools:

  * East US App + DB
  * West US App + DB
* Configure health probes for failover.
* Optionally add WAF.

### Step 6: **Testing Failover**

* In Recovery Services Vault ‚Üí run a **Test Failover** (non-disruptive).
* Verify app works from West US.
* Document **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**.

### Step 7: **Failback**

* After East US recovers, perform **planned failback**.
* Sync changes from West US ‚Üí East US.
* Switch traffic back via Front Door.

# üîπ Example Flow Diagram (Words)

1. **Users** ‚Üí Azure Front Door
2. Front Door ‚Üí East US App Service / VM / AKS Pods

   * Connected to SQL Always On (East US primary).
   * Storage (GRS).
3. If East US down ‚Üí Front Door health probe fails ‚Üí Redirect to West US App Service / VM / AKS Pods.
4. West US SQL secondary becomes primary.
5. Website stays available with minimal downtime.

---

# üîπ Key Considerations

* **RPO/RTO**: Define business tolerance for data loss & downtime.
* **Cost**: Running active-active (App Service in both regions) costs more than active-passive (replicating only).
* **Testing**: Run quarterly DR drills.
* **Automation**: Use **Azure Site Recovery Recovery Plans** to automate failover sequences (DB first ‚Üí app ‚Üí frontend).

---

‚úÖ In summary:

* Use **ASR for VM-based workloads**, **geo-replication for databases**, and **global load balancing (Front Door)** for traffic management.
* Build a **multi-region architecture** where East US is primary, West US is secondary.
* In disaster ‚Üí traffic + DB + apps shift to West US.
