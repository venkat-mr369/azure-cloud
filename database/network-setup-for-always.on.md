Step by Step configure the process **network → subnets → load balancers → Always On + App Failover**.
**Always On SQL + Full Application DR** across **two Azure regions (East US + West US)**

---

### 🔹 1. Networking OVerflow (Per Region)

In Azure, **VPC = VNet**. Each region will have its own **VNet**.

### Example:

* **East US VNet** → `10.10.0.0/16`

  * Subnet1: `10.10.1.0/24` → Frontend (App Service Env, Web VMs, App Gateway)
  * Subnet2: `10.10.2.0/24` → Backend (App Servers / Pods)
  * Subnet3: `10.10.3.0/24` → Database (SQL Always On VMs)
  * Subnet4: `10.10.4.0/24` → Management / Bastion

* **West US VNet** → `10.20.0.0/16`

  * Subnet1: `10.20.1.0/24` → Frontend
  * Subnet2: `10.20.2.0/24` → Backend
  * Subnet3: `10.20.3.0/24` → Database
  * Subnet4: `10.20.4.0/24` → Management

➡️ These VNets must be connected with **VNet-to-VNet VPN** or **Azure Global VNet Peering** (low latency, high speed) so Always On replicas can sync.

# 🔹 2. Load Balancing Setup 

Azure has multiple load balancers, each used at different layers of the stack:

### 1. **Internal Load Balancer (ILB)**

* Used for **SQL Always On Listener** inside **VNet**.
* Provides single IP that apps connect to (`sql-listener.eastus.local`).
* In failover, listener moves to secondary replica automatically.

### 2. **Azure Standard Load Balancer**

* Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) load balancing.
* Used inside region for VM pools (e.g., multiple Java web VMs).
* Can be **internal** (private) or **public**.

### 3. **Application Gateway**

* Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).
* Handles SSL termination, WAF, routing, sticky sessions.
* Used if your web app runs on VMs or AKS.

### 4. **Azure Front Door (Recommended for Multi-Region DR)**

* Global load balancer at Microsoft’s edge.
* Distributes traffic across **East US** and **West US** regions.
* Uses health probes — if East US fails, traffic auto-switches to West US.
* Works across VNets, regions, and services.

### 5. **Traffic Manager**

* DNS-based global load balancer.
* Slower failover (DNS TTL).
* Used where Front Door is not needed.

---

### 🔹 3. SQL Always On + Load Balancer Setup

#### In **East US**

* Deploy SQL Always On Cluster nodes in `10.10.3.0/24` (Database Subnet).
* Deploy **Internal Load Balancer (ILB)** in same subnet with probe on port `59999`.
* Configure SQL Listener (`sql-east-listener`) with ILB IP.

#### In **West US**

* Same: SQL replicas in `10.20.3.0/24`, ILB, probe, listener (`sql-west-listener`).

### Global Access

* Create **Azure Traffic Manager profile** for SQL Listener DNS:

  * `sql-global.mydomain.com` → Points to East + West listeners.
  * Priority routing (East primary, West secondary).
  * Failover: If East listener fails, Traffic Manager directs apps to West.

---

### 🔹 4. App Layer Load Balancing

### If Java Apps run on **VMs**

* Deploy VMs in Backend Subnet (`10.10.2.0/24`, `10.20.2.0/24`).
* Place them behind **Azure Standard Load Balancer (per region)**.
* Optionally, add **Application Gateway** (for WAF + SSL).

### If Java Apps run on **App Service**

* Use **App Service Plan with deployment slots** in both regions.
* No ILB needed — App Service integrates with Front Door directly.

### If Java Apps run on **AKS Pods**

* Deploy AKS clusters in both VNets.
* Use **Internal Load Balancer service** inside AKS (`Service type: LoadBalancer`).
* Integrate with **Front Door** for global distribution.

---

# 🔹 5. Global Load Balancing Flow

Here’s how requests move:

1. **User → Azure Front Door** (public entry point).

   * Example DNS: `www.myapp.com`.

2. **Front Door checks health probes** in both regions.

   * If East US App Gateway healthy → sends traffic to East.
   * If East down → fails over to West automatically.

3. **Within region**:

   * Front Door → App Gateway → Backend Pool (VMs/Pods).
   * Backend connects to SQL Listener (ILB) → Always On DB.

4. **If DB fails over**:

   * SQL Listener automatically points to West replica (via ILB + AG failover).
   * Front Door ensures traffic aligns with healthy DB region.

# 🔹 6. Example IP/DNS Setup

| Component             | East US        | West US        | Global / DR               |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| VNet CIDR             | `10.10.0.0/16` | `10.20.0.0/16` | Peered                    |
| SQL Listener ILB IP   | `10.10.3.10`   | `10.20.3.10`   | `sql-global.mydomain.com` |
| App Gateway Public IP | `52.x.x.10`    | `52.x.x.20`    | Front Door entrypoint     |
| Front Door URL        | —              | —              | `www.myapp.com`           |

---

# 🔹 7. End-to-End Flow (Words)

* **Normal (East US Primary):**
  User → Front Door → East US App Gateway → Web VMs → SQL Listener (East ILB) → DB Primary.

* **Failover (East Down):**
  User → Front Door health probe fails → Route to West US App Gateway → Web VMs → SQL Listener (West ILB) → DB Secondary (now promoted).

---

# 🔹 8. DR Best Practices as Microsoft recommeneded 

✅ Use **Standard Load Balancers** (Basic doesn’t support Availability Zones).
✅ Keep **subnet design identical** in both regions (easy failover).
✅ Use **Global VNet Peering** for low-latency replication.
✅ Always enable **Recovery Services Vault + ASR** for VM-based workloads.
✅ Run **DR drills** to test failover end-to-end.
